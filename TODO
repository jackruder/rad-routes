- UI: clicking on a card should bring you to the page for that card
    this means we must call e.stopPropogate or whatever its called when users click on the links within a card
    and we will probably get rid of the link to a card's children
- UI: make author page, where all their guidebooks are listed
- UI: handle private listed cards more elegantly
- TESTING: flesh out apitest.py

- DEPLOYMENT: get django to map its non-api 404 to the react 404
