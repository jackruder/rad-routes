# Rad Routes

Routes, but they're rad.

### Development Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/apc518/rad-routes.git
cd rad-routes
sudo chmod +rwx deploy.bash
```

Now you open up two terminals, one for the front and one for the server. Whenever you are done with a feature and are ready to push it to the main repo, simply commit your changes to `front/` and then run `deploy.bash`
